This is a todo app, we can add, delete, etc taks. This project was developed with VanillaJS and Vite.
I made a store like pinia from zero, this provides a way to create stores for managing the state of the application. You can try it clicking the next link: <a href="https://vite-todo-app-75.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Vite ToDo App</a>


Vite is a build tool and development server for modern web applications. It is designed to optimize the development experience by focusing on fast, efficient builds and a rapid development server. Vite is particularly well-suited for building Single Page Applications (SPAs) and other web projects.

Key features of Vite include:

1. **Fast Development Server:** Vite provides a development server that is optimized for speed. It leverages native ES Module (ESM) imports to serve modules individually, resulting in faster hot module replacement (HMR) and quicker development feedback.

2. **ESM (ECMAScript Module) Support:** Vite is built with native support for ECMAScript Modules, allowing developers to use modern JavaScript module syntax without the need for additional bundling during development.

3. **Plugin System:** Vite has a plugin system that allows developers to extend its functionality. This makes it flexible and adaptable to different project requirements.

4. **Built-in Support for Vue.js:** Vite was initially created with a focus on supporting Vue.js projects, providing a smooth development experience for Vue applications. However, it can be used with other frameworks or even for plain JavaScript projects.

5. **Optimized Production Builds:** While Vite's development server serves individual modules for speed, it can generate optimized production builds for deployment. It leverages Rollup under the hood for bundling and tree-shaking, resulting in smaller and more efficient bundles.

In summary, Vite is a modern build tool that enhances the development experience by prioritizing speed and leveraging native ESM features. It's particularly popular in the Vue.js ecosystem but can be used for various JavaScript projects.
